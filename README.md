# Keeper App

This is a simple implementation of a note taking web application where users can create new notes and delete unwanted notes.

There is no database in this project, so the notes will be deleted once the page is refreshed.

_This project is based on the Udemy Course ["The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST15MT100124A) by Dr.Angela Yu_

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
